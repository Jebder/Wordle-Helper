1. Possibly need to make list with more columns because word list can be too big to scroll though. Fit more words on screen.

2. Keyboard on the bottom with all the pretty stuff ie..hover/click colors.

3. Make pretty? I think it looks simple and nice already but we could put some flare on it. 

4. Logic for winning game.

5. Needs to change colors and what not for correct, correct but wrong spot, and wrong.

6. *Add a header above the word list to specificy what it is. At first, it will be a starting word list (eventually ranked by best startign word)
and then it will just be a word list. Could look tacky and make everything unaligned.* Could be dogshit. Needs further analysis.
